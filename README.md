# Python Basics

Understanding the fundamentals of Python, including syntax, data types, variables, and basic operations. This forms the foundation for more advanced programming concepts.

## Object-Oriented Programming

Applying the principles of object-oriented programming, including classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. This paradigm enhances code organization and modularity.

## Interpreted Languages

Python is an interpreted language, meaning that the source code is executed line by line by an interpreter, allowing for dynamic and interactive development.

## Test Driven Development

Developing software through a process that involves writing tests before writing the actual code. This helps ensure code correctness, maintainability, and reliability.

## Error Handling

Implementing mechanisms to handle errors gracefully during program execution, preventing crashes and improving the robustness of the code.

## I/O (Input/Output)

Dealing with input and output operations in Python, such as reading from and writing to files, user input, and interacting with external data sources.

## Web Scraping

Extracting information from websites by parsing HTML and other web page components. Web scraping is a valuable skill for data extraction and automation tasks.
