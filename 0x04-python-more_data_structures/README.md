### 0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

#### Introduction
This project focuses on exploring Python's data structures, specifically sets and dictionaries, along with the concepts of lambda functions, map, filter, and reduce functions. The tasks involve writing Python functions to perform various operations on sets and dictionaries.

#### Learning Objectives
- Understand the use of sets and dictionaries in Python.
- Differentiate between sets, lists, and dictionaries based on use cases.
- Implement operations on sets, such as iterating and finding common elements.
- Work with dictionaries, including key-value pairs and iteration.
- Gain familiarity with lambda functions, map, filter, and reduce functions.

#### Requirements
- **Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Interpreter:** Python 3.8.5 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Code Style:** PEP 8 using pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- **Execution:** All files must be executable
- **Documentation:** A README.md file is mandatory
