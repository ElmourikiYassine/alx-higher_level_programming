# JavaScript Objects, Scopes, Closures - Project Readme

This repository contains solutions to a series of JavaScript tasks related to object-oriented programming, scopes, and closures. Below, you'll find a brief description of each task along with the corresponding files.

## Task 0: Rectangle #0

**File:** `0-rectangle.js`

**Description:** This task involves defining an empty class `Rectangle` using the class notation.

---

## Task 1: Rectangle #1

**File:** `1-rectangle.js`

**Description:** In this task, a class `Rectangle` is defined with a constructor that takes two arguments (`w` and `h`). The instance attributes `width` and `height` are initialized with the values of `w` and `h`.

---

## Task 2: Rectangle #2

**File:** `2-rectangle.js`

**Description:** The class `Rectangle` is extended to handle cases where `w` or `h` is equal to 0 or not a positive integer. If this condition is met, an empty object is created.

---

## Task 3: Rectangle #3

**File:** `3-rectangle.js`

**Description:** The `Rectangle` class is enhanced with an instance method `print()` that prints the rectangle using the character 'X'.

---

## Task 4: Rectangle #4

**File:** `4-rectangle.js`

**Description:** The `Rectangle` class is further extended with instance methods `rotate()` and `double()`. The `rotate()` method exchanges the width and height of the rectangle, while the `double()` method multiplies both width and height by 2.

---

## Task 5: Square #0

**File:** `5-square.js`

**Description:** A new class `Square` is created, which inherits from the `Rectangle` class. The constructor takes a single argument (`size`), and the `Rectangle` constructor is called using `super()`.

---

## Task 6: Square #1

**File:** `6-square.js`

**Description:** The `Square` class is extended to include an instance method `charPrint(c)` that prints the square using the character `c`. If `c` is undefined, 'X' is used.

---

## Task 7: Occurrences

**File:** `7-occurrences.js`

**Description:** A function `nbOccurences` is implemented, which returns the number of occurrences of a specified element in a list.

---

## Task 8: Esrever

**File:** `8-esrever.js`

**Description:** A function `esrever` is created to return the reversed version of a list without using the built-in `reverse` method.

---

## Task 9: Log me

**File:** `9-logme.js`

**Description:** A function `logMe` is implemented to print the number of arguments already printed and the new argument value.

---

## Task 10: Number conversion

**File:** `10-converter.js`

**Description:** A function `converter` is created that takes a base as an argument and returns a function. The returned function converts a number from base 10 to the specified base.
